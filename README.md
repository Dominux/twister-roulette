# Twister roulette

*Inspired by [another project](https://twister-roulette.com/en)*

### [Online Demo](https://dominux.github.io/twister-roulette)

## Why?

One day at some party we were playing Twister and we needed the roulette. And one dude decided to download some first found app on his phone. Moreover it was downloading and installing for around __a minute__!

And it's clear that we don't need to use an app for such a simple task. So I decided to create my own implementation.

## Features:

### PWA

The main thing here (which another project doesn't have BTW) is providing [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/). This feature grants us ability to  use our web apps like if they would be native ones. Hence you can install it and use as an app on your device:

   </tr> 
   <tr>
      <td>Desktop</td>
      <td>Mobile</td>
  </tr>
</table>
